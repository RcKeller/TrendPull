# TrendPull

This is a brand-new work in progress package - functionality is not expected at this stage.

TrendPull provides an interface between market and SEO researchers and google trends that allows the mass-mining, collection, and dissemination of google search trend data. It supports both ad-hoc pulls and using .csv lists of data to pull thousands of trends at once.

##### Requires:
 - Python 2.7
 - pytrends (any)
 - lxml (not always on pip, .whl file included in the env directory)
 - Microsoft C++ Compiler for Python
